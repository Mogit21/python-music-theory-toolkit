ðŸŽ¹ Try It Online

You can explore and interact with the toolkit in two ways:

1. Google Colab (Recommended for Tutorials & Learning)

Run the examples and demos from your browser â€” no installation required.

Ideal for learning, experimenting, and modifying code interactively.

Each notebook in examples/ can be opened directly in Colab.

Try it: Open in Google Colab

2. Streamlit App (Recommended for Interactive Use)

A web app that lets you interact with the toolkit without touching the code.

Choose scales, generate chords, train your ear, and export MIDI/Sheet Music with a simple interface.

Uses the main script app/app.py and can be deployed online via Streamlit Cloud or your own server.
